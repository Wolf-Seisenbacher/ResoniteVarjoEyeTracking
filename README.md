# NeosVarjoEyeTracking 

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/)  
Integrates Varjo's eye tracking into NeosVR. Tracks per eye and combined:

## Usage
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Download the latest release, and extract the zip file's contents to your mods folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader.
3. Start the game!

If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs, equip an eye-tracking ready avatar, or create an EmptyObject with an AvatarRawEyeData Component (Found under Users -> Common Avatar System -> Face -> AvatarRawEyeData).
